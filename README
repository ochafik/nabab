Bayesian Network inference engine, which features :
- ability to read bayesian networks from files in the XMLBIF 0.3 format
- inference engine that uses the junction tree algorithm and knows about observations
- attractive Swing user interface with mouse-over effects, movable and expandable nodes (does not let you enter observations yet… work in progress)
- custom graph library

This project was previously not open-source, but after a request from Cédrick Béler I agreed to release it under the MIT License (to make it possible to port the library to Smalltalk).
